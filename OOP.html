    <h5>Object-Oriented Programming</h5>
    <!-- First card containing the tutorial -->
    <p>Object-Oriented Programming is a type of computer-programming modelled on classes and objects. With Object-Oriented Programming, we can create classes (blueprints) and instances of classes (objects). These objects have certain variables (attributes) and behaviours (methods) that are written in their code. To create an object, we must use a constructor that is already written in the class. On top of this, classes can inherit data from a super class in the same way that a chihuahua inherits attributes and behaviours of a dog such as fur colour and barking.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Key Facts</strong></p>
    <li>Classes often represents things that are nouns (i.e Animals, Vehicles and Countries)</li>
    <li> Methods often represent things that are verbs (i.e. barking, travelling and growing)</li>
    <li>Objects are stored into RAM and the address of that storage is stored into a reference variable.</li>

    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Object-Oriented programming (OOP) is a type of computer programming based on the concept of "objects", which can have data in the form of fields/variables (attributes), and code, in the form of methods (behaviours).</p>
    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Above, we see a classic example of OOP in action. We, created our Vehicle class, set some data fields such as amount of doors and engine size, created a default constructor and a paremtized constructor and we added some methods or behaviours including drive and reverse. We also added a subclass called Car that inherits the Vehicle class. It has a new method called openTrunk.</p>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The problem essentially was creating a model of object-oriented program. I decided to use a real-life example of vehicles and reflected it using Java. Our Vehicle class contains fields or charecteristics that can be found in most vehicles; A vehicle has-a wheels, doors, engine size, number of seats and a liscense plate. This class contains methods that most vehicles can do including drive, reverse and honk. We created a subclass called Car which is-a vehicle. It has the same fields as vehicle, but can include more. It also has the same methods as vehicle, but it can be defined further.</p>
