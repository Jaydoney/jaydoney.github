	<h2>Action vs. Inaction</h2>

	<p>In the senior years of my high school experience, my classmates and I were required to read two Shakespeare plays, MacBeth and Hamlet. Macbeth was an amazing play to read, seeing Macbeth challenge his 'fate' and to manifest his own destiny was a mind-blowing experience. Can us humans in the real-world reach the unattainable things in life such as Macbeth did in the play? Just as Macbeth had seized the Kingdom of Scotland by any means nescessary, can we have the same fire to chase and run after our dreams?</p>

	<p>Hamlet, on the other hand, is a man who let's his own story write itself. Rather than brandishing the pencil in which he could write his story of restoring honour to the Danish Throne and avenging his father's death, he would rather wait and think and be sad and think some more. This ultimately led to his untimely death which would have never come to pass had he striked first. </p>

	<p>So as we go through our own individual plays that we call life, what should we choose? Action or inaction? Should we move the world around us to our liking or should we stand still and have the world move us? Should we seek to better our lives through ambition or should we stay put? IN both Hamlet and Macbeth, they both ended up dead unfortunately which is maybe an underlying motif. No matter how you live life, being a main character or just as someone on the fringes of relevance, perhaps it doesn't matter.</p>

	<h2>Has Music Dipped in Quality?</h2>

	<p>As I shuffle through my Spotify playlist, I can't help but wonder why most of the songs on there are older ones rather than recent. Is music just garbage? I really wanted to put this hyopothesis to the test, so I did what any other scientist would do. I paid 5 bucks to 3 kids in my class and asked them to listen to two seperate playlists, music from before 2017 and music after 2017.</p>

	<p>The decision was almost unanimous. Pre-2017 music was the favourite among my paid study participants, but why? Why are genres like pop and hip-hop lacking in quality compared to former years?</p>

	<p>I could chalk it up to a bunch of different reasons including, the lower attention spans of the general population due to smartphone additcions, the emphasis our society places on the artist rather than the art or how it is easier than ever for artists to launch their music online. However, I think the thought that "music is getting worse" is just in our heads. There are literally thousands of different types of music out there that you have yet to explore. If you'e getting bored of the same hip-hop and pop tunes on the radio(I know I am..) then go out there and discover Taiwanese Folk Music! </p>
