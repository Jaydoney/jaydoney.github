	<h2>Rest in Peace, Joe Schlesinger</h2>

	<p>Today, while I tediously drove across the bumper-to-bumper traffic which is the 401, I learned about Joe Schlesinger on CBC Radio. After hearing about both the accomplishments this man has attained and the tribulations he has faced, I am almost ashamed I haven’t learned of him sooner. Schlesinger, while still a boy, had to leave his parents(who unfortunately died in the Holocaust) behind in Czechoslovakia and flee to England with his younger brother to escape persecution from Hitler and the Nazis. I can't even begin to fathom the emotional trauma and survivors' guilt Schlesinger most likely felt at the time. Despite all this, he persevered and become one of Canada's most well-known journalists.</p>
	
	<p>Schlesinger was a foreign correspondent for CBC and was responsible for reporting on  major world issues including, the fall of the Berlin Wall(1991), the first Gulf War(1990-1991) and the fall of the Shah in Iran(1979). Schlesinger wanted to inform Canadians of the issues going on around the world and how these issues impacted real people. Schlesinger was once one of those real people impacted by issues in a foreign country. </p>
	
        <p>After hearing about this great man, I was inspired to both be more informed of the world going around me and to have the same drive as Joe Schlesinger did.  A refugee, who as a child lost both parents and was exiled from his own country by a dictator, went on to broadcast to Canadians some of the greatest stories of all time, yet his greatest story was his own. </p>

	<h2>Has Music Dipped in Quality?</h2>
	
	<p>As I shuffle through my Spotify playlist, I can't help but wonder why most of the songs on there are older rather than recent. Is new music just garbage? I really wanted to put this hypothesis to the test, so I did what any other scientist would do. I paid 5 bucks to 3 kids in my class and asked them to listen to two seperate playlists, my favourite tracks from before 2017 and my favourite tracks from after. </p>
	
	<p>The decision was almost unanimous. Pre-2017 music was the favourite among my paid study participants, but why? Why are genres like pop and hip-hop lacking in quality compared to former years?</p>
	
	<p>I could chalk it up to a bunch of different reasons including, the lower attention spans of the general population due to smartphone addictions which in turn causes us to prefer catchy, lower quality music over boring, impactful music, the emphasis our society places on the artist rather than the art or how it is easier than ever for artists to launch their music online. Despite all these “theories”, I think the notion that "music is getting worse" is just one in our heads. There are literally thousands of different types of music out there that we have yet to explore, so if you're getting bored of the same hip-hop and pop tunes on the radio(I know I am..) then go out there and discover some Taiwanese Folk Music! </p>

	<h2>Action vs. Inaction</h2>
	
	<p>In the senior years of my high school experience, my classmates and I were required to read two Shakespeare plays, MacBeth and Hamlet. Macbeth was an amazing play to read, seeing Macbeth challenge his 'fate' and to manifest his own destiny was incredible to say the least. Can us humans in the real-world reach the unattainable things in life such as Macbeth did in the play? Just as Macbeth had seized the Kingdom of Scotland by any means necessary, can we have the same fire to chase and run after our dreams?</p>

	<p>Hamlet, on the other hand, is a man who seems to have no fire at all. He lets his story write itself and makes no action towards accomplishing his goals like avenging his father.  Rather than brandishing the pencil in which he could write his story of restoring honour to the Danish Throne and avenging his father's death, he would rather wait and think and be sad and think some more. This inaction on his part ultimately led to his death. </p>

	<p>So as we go through our own individual plays that we call life, what should we choose? Action or inaction? Should we be the determinants of our own fate or should we just stay put and hope that life will just work out? Should we seek to better our lives through ambition like Macbeth or just chill like Hamlet? When we get to the ending of the plays however, we realize that even though Macbeth is a man of action and Hamlet is almost the complete opposite, they both end up dead. Perhaps Shakespeare had an underlying motif while writing this play. No matter how we choose to live our life, it will come to an end, so perhaps we should seek to make our play as exciting as possible. Maybe that’s why I like Macbeth so much.</p>
